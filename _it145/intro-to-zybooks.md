# Overview
These notes are intended to help you quickly become productive using the <a href="https://zybooks.zyante.com">zyBooks</a> resource.
# Participation
Unlike traditional printed textbooks, the interactive nature of zyBooks requires that you, the reader, participate in the learning material. If you skip sections because you’re in a rush, you will not receive credit towards participation. Throughout the chapters you will encounter Participation Activities that require you to input values, answer questions, or click through animations in order to fully learn the material.

Here is an example of a Participation Activity before you interact with the material:

By clicking the orange “Start” button inside the box, you can click through the steps and watch the animations build up the material.

After completing all the steps you’ll see the Participation “badge” on the left colored in:

#### Participation Afterward

# Lab Activities
zyBooks has an interesting feature allowing you to type the program source for a lab activity right inside the book on the website. When you click “Run Program” that source will be compiled and executed right there in the page. In fact, it will execute your program several times with different inputs and then examine the output produced when calculating your grade.

Because the program is executed within the textbook environment, you have to provide all the inputs needed prior to running the program. This is a different experience than when you write, compile and execute a program outside of ZyBooks on your computer, e.g. using NetBeans.
