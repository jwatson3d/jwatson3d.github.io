## Overview
These notes are intended to help you quickly become productive using the <a href="https://zybooks.zyante.com">zyBooks</a> resource.

### Participation
Unlike traditional printed textbooks, the interactive nature of zyBooks requires that you, the reader, participate in the learning material. If you skip sections because you’re in a rush, you will not receive credit towards participation. Throughout the chapters you will encounter Participation Activities that require you to input values, answer questions, or click through animations in order to fully learn the material.<br><br>
Here is an example of a Participation Activity before you interact with the material:<br><a href="http://blog.pragmatictech.guru/img/introzybooks/it145-zybooks-part-before.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://blog.pragmatictech.guru/img/introzybooks/it145-zybooks-part-before_tn.jpg" class="yui-img" title="Participation Beforehand" alt="Participation Beforehand" style="width: 192px; margin: 5px;"></a><br><b>Participation Beforehand</b><br><br>By clicking the orange “Start” button inside the box, you can click through the steps and watch the animations build up the material.<br><br>After completing all the steps you’ll see the Participation “badge” on the left colored in:<br><a href="http://blog.pragmatictech.guru/img/introzybooks/it145-zybooks-part-award.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://blog.pragmatictech.guru/img/introzybooks/it145-zybooks-part-award_tn.jpg" class="yui-img" style="width: 192px; margin: 5px;" title="Participation Afterward" alt="Participation Afterward"></a><br><b>Participation Afterward</b>

### Lab Activities
zyBooks has an interesting feature allowing you to type the program source for a lab activity right inside the book on the website. When you click “Run Program” that source will be compiled and executed right there in the page. In fact, it will execute your program several times with different inputs during "Submit" mode and then examine the output produced when calculating your grade.<br><br>
Because the program is executed within the textbook environment, you have to provide all the inputs needed prior to running the program. This is a different experience than when you write, compile and execute a program outside of ZyBooks on your computer, e.g. using NetBeans.<br><br><a href="http://blog.pragmatictech.guru/img/introzybooks/it145-zybooks-lab-1.10.1-input.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://blog.pragmatictech.guru/img/introzybooks/it145-zybooks-lab-1.10.1-input_tn.jpg" class="yui-img" title="Lab Inputs" alt="Lab Inputs" style="width: 154px; margin: 5px;"></a><br><br>Here’s an example output showing the results of running the program:<br><a href="http://blog.pragmatictech.guru/img/introzybooks/it145-zybooks-lab-1.10.1-output.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://blog.pragmatictech.guru/img/introzybooks/it145-zybooks-lab-1.10.1-output_tn.jpg" class="yui-img" style="width: 187px; margin: 5px;" title="Lab Results" alt="Lab Results"></a><br><br><b>NOTE</b>: <span class="yui-tag-span yui-tag" tag="span" style=""><i><span class="yui-tag-span yui-tag" tag="span" style="">If</span> you are new to programming you'll be in for a rude awakening when you first submit your code. Why? Because you'll likely find zyBooks reports many errors. Once you look closely at these errors and the "Expected Output" you'll quickly realize that every character, every space and every line feed counts. Your program needs to output exactly as zyBooks expects. Rather than getting frustrated by saying "it looks right to me", just go ahead and make the necessary adjustments so your program output exactly matches what is expected.</i>
## Suggested Approach
Learn to code and test in small bites - don't try typing in the entire program and run it afterwards. The likelihood of too many typos and mistakes will cause a long, cascading list of errors to correct.<br><a href="http://blog.pragmatictech.guru/img/introzybooks/it145-zybooks-lab-1.13.1-hints.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://blog.pragmatictech.guru/img/introzybooks/it145-zybooks-lab-1.13.1-hints_tn.jpg" class="yui-img" title="Lab Hints" alt="Lab Hints" style="width: 256px; margin: 5px;"></a><br><br>In the example shown above, code just enough to satisfy the requirements of part (1) and then test it - key in sample input values and click "Run Program". Ensure that the output from your program matches the sample output shown in the shaded gray box.

This clip succinctly summarizes the accumulated wisdom of experienced programmers. If you follow this advice you'll be far less frustrated and far more productive:<br><gcb-youtube videoid="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yl6s6DGapug" instanceid="zZNyv3MquH5S"></gcb-youtube><br>
