The Java programming language borrows heavily from the C-dialect as does C++ and C# so if you are familiar with those programming languages you'll find the transition to Java syntax to be smooth. Java 1.0 was released over twenty years ago in 1995 and now in it's ninth major release. You'll find many new terms and acronyms that you'll have to learn with Java so let's go over a few of them. Java is a compiled language which means that you write your programs using a plain text editor program - <b>not</b> a word-processing program such as Microsoft Word or Open Office - and save them in files that have ".java" extension after the filename - know as <i>source files</i>. These source files, containing Java statements, are then used by a special program called a compiler that translates the source code into machine executable instructions and saved in another file with the ".class" extension. These <i>class files</i> can then be run like other programs on your computer. The below graphic from the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/getStarted/intro/index.html" target="_blank" title="Java Technology Phenomenon">Java Technology Phenomenon</a> illustrates the stages from a plain text Java source file to a program that runs on your computer.<br><br><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/getStarted/intro/definition.html" target="_blank"><img src="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/figures/getStarted/getStarted-compiler.gif"></a><br><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2;"><i>An overview of the software development process.</i></span><br><br>As you can see there's another piece in the middle between the compiled Java class file and the program running on your computer - called the <a href="https://techterms.com/definition/jvm" target="_blank" title="Java Virtual Machine">Java Virtual Machine</a>, or JVM. The JVM was created when Java was developed to overcome a huge problem that existed in software development in the 90's and before - different hardware platforms with different processors meant programs had to be compiled specifically for each platform. These platforms meant that there were also different compilers built specifically for that platform. This variety of platforms, processors, and compilers lead to differences in how the programs ran and even what the programs were able to do because of the underlying technology differences. Programmers all over the world had to write special case logic if they wanted their program to run on different hardware - millions of programmers were all struggling to make sure their code would run on a wide variety of hardware platforms.<br><br>The Java designers solved this vexing and costly problem by creating a "virtual machine" that all Java code was built to run on which freed everyone from having to code special exceptions into their programs. Instead, a single <a href="https://techterms.com/definition/jre" target="_blank" title="Java Runtime Environment">Java Runtime Environment</a> (JRE) was written for each hardware platform that translated the common Java class file instructions into native machine instructions for a platform. The complexities of the hardware platform were suddenly abstracted away from the application programmers who could then focus on the logic of their awesome, mind-bending application instead of tricky hardware differences.

1. The <u>Java Language</u> shown at the top, which you will be introduced to in this course.
2. The <u>Java Development Kit</u> (JDK) which you will need installed on your computer in order to <i style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">develop</i> Java programs written using the Java Language.
3. The <u>Java Runtime Environment</u> (JRE), a subset of the JDK, must be installed on a computer in order to <i style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">run</i> compile Java programs (class files).
4. The <u>Java Standard Edition</u> (Java SE) packages a significant portion of the Java platform API needed to develop rich, portable code that can run on desktops and servers.
 
The light blue shaded boxes just below the Java Language at the top are the tools installed with the JDK that you will use to develop Java programs. Of them, the two most important tools are:<br>

1. java - this is the command that runs a Java program (class file) by first starting the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and then loading and running the class you specified.
2. javac - this is the Java compiler that reads your Java source file and creates a Java class file that can be run with the 'java' command.<br>
