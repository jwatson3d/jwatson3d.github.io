When I started blogging in 2004 I used [Geeks with Blogs](http://geekswithblogs.net/jwatson/Default.aspx) later moving on to [Blogger](http://pragmatic-software.blogspot.com/) in 2008. Fast forward to 2017 and I'm now working with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for static content generation.
