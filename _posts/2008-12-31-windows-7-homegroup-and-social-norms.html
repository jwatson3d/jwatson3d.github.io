<p></p>A great post landed today from the Windows 7 Engineering team that made me stop my usual "partial-brain" scanning of daily information sources and actually read it slowly: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/e7/archive/2008/12/30/at-home-with-homegroup-in-windows-7.aspx" target="_blank">At Home with HomeGroup in Windows 7</a>. Not only was it well written and informative, but it shows the openness which blogging has brought about - insight into the team's thinking and processes. Their approach to looking at the technology problem from a social engineering perspective is great - I need to do more of this. How many times have we (ok, maybe just me) looked at a problem with thoughts of design patterns, technology approach, and which tools to use?
